include stdlib.h in ft_mem.h
Get help with strlcat
I think strchr has issues...

add ft_put.h to libft.h

change ft_strcmp to something that makes sense

change all functions headers to libft.h, make sure libft.h contains all necessary includes
NULL is in sys/types.h

After self-testing, test with 42filechecker
